             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\n
      (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its\n

             attribution notices contained within such NOTICE\n
             file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to\n
             any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of\n
             the following places: within a NOTICE text file\n

             such third-party notices normally appear. The\n
             contents of the NOTICE file are for informational\n
             purposes only an do not modify the License. You\n
             may add Your own attribution notices within\n
             Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as\n
             an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,\n
             provided that such additional attribution notices\n
             cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n\n
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your\n
      modifications and may provide additional or different\n
      license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or\n
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such\n
      Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise\n
      complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly\n
   state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally\n
   submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor\n
   shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,\n
   without any additional terms or conditions.\n
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede\n
   or modify the terms of any separate license agreement\n
   you may have executed with Licensor regarding such\n
   Contributions.\n\n
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to\n
   use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or\n
   product names of the Licensor, except as required for\n
   reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of\n

   law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work\n
   (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an\n
   'AS IS' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\n
   OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,\n
   without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,\n
   NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR\n
   A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for\n
   determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing\n
   the Work and assume any risks associated with Your\n
   exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal\n
   theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract,\n
   or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as\n
   deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in\n
   writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for\n
   damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\n
   or consequential damages of any character arising\n
   as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to\n
   use the Work (including but not limited to damages\n
   for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or\n
   malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or\n
   losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the\n
   possibility of such damages.\n\n
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While\n
   redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You\n
   may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of\n
   support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations\n
   and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in\n
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own\n
   behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any\n
   other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any\n
   liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such\n
   Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty\n
   or additional liability.\n\n
